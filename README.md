# moondial
A visualization tool for understanding how time behaves differently on the Moon.

Clocks on the lunar surface tick 56 microseconds faster per Earth day due to relativistic effects. Without correction, this drift compounds into kilometers of navigation error. `moondial` shows Earth and lunar clocks diverging in real time, demonstrating what happens when GPS disappears, and translating microseconds into the meters that matter for spacecraft.
